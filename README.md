## Framework Sanity

A common question when setting up a project in a framework that may be unfamiliar too you is, "Wait? Is this thing even connected right?"

I've spent what feels like an eternity debugging problems that aren't even there. Well, what can *YOU* do to spend less time setting up that Angular App and more time actually building it? Stay tuned....


## The Sanity Check

Setting up a project's structure should be very methodical. There should be a clear reason why a particular file lives in its particular place. Knowing this, developers often spend a lot of time debugging other potential problems before checking to see if the framework they are using is set up correctly and working how they expect. Whenever I set up a new project boilerplate, I mock-out content for my components so I know they are working. Given the following sample wireframe for a project to recreate a shopping cart, I will walk you through my steps to make sure no time is wasted getting started.
